    "# Saltwater Intrusion Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "A growing coastal city is interested in developing a wellfield in order to provide potable drinking water to its residents.  You have been contracted by the city to perform a numerical analysis to determine the effects of groundwater withdrawals on the position of the saltwater interface.  The city is particularly interested in knowing if the planned withdrawal rate will result in pumped water that exceeds the drinking water standard for chloride, which is 250 mg/L.  In addition, you have been asked by the city to delineate a wellfield protection zone by determining the approximate recharge area for the wellfield.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The study area consists of a 10 by 10 km area of a coastal plain aquifer system centered on the proposed wellfield (Figure 1).  The hydrogeology of the area consists of a shallow and deep aquifer, and both aquifers intersect the sea floor (Figure 2).  The two aquifers are separated by a discontinuous confining layer that thickens to the east.  The confining layer is present in the eastern part of the study area, but is absent in the western part.  A low permeability unit, which slopes downward to the east, underlies the deep aquifer and can be considered a no flow boundary.  Extensive field investigations have been performed, and the aquifer properties for the different units are summarized in the table below.  Annual average recharge was determined to be 25.4 cm/yr (10 in/yr).\n",

    "Unfortunately, due to limitations in available property, the city has only one option for wellfield location, which is shown on the map in Figure 1.  The city is hoping to capture at least 25% of the recharge for the area, but there is an obvious concern that excessive pumping from the deep aquifer could cause the saltwater interface to move inland and contaminate the wellfield.\n",

The purpose of this next, optional analysis is to shut off the variable density component in SEAWAT and quantify the effects on the simulated concentration in cell (20, 50, 50) and on the water budget.  There are several ways to perform a simulation where the density effects are neglected: (1) make the DENSESLP equal to zero, (2) remove the vdf package from the simulation, or (3) use MODFLOW and MT3DMS.

In this exercise, you will use MODPATH to perform forward and backward particle tracking analysis to delineate the recharge area for the city’s proposed wellfield.  The cell-by-cell flow file that was created during the 20 year pumping simulation from SWI_IIB contains the intercell flows for the entire simulation.  Flows from the last transport time step will be used to determine the well-field protection area.  By performing this particle tracking analysis, we are assuming that these intercell flows remained constant throughout the simulation.  If we wanted to see the effects of transient intercell flows on the particle movement, we would need to rerun the SEAWAT simulation with additional MODFLOW time steps so that the intercell flows could be saved more frequently.\n",

Then a MODPATH simulation package is created using the well package.
