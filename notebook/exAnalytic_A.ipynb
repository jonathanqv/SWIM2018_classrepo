    "Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers may be simulated as interface flow when the transition zone between the freshwater and saltwater is relatively thin.

In Dupuit interface models, the resistance to vertical flow is neglected within an aquifer, so that the vertical head distribution is hydrostatic.

It is emphasized that the resulting flow field is still  three-dimensional, as the vertical component of the flow my be computed from continuity of flow. In a Dupuit interface model, the outflow zone along the sea bottom is zero (unless a resistance to outflow is specified along the sea bottom, as we will do in the second half of this Notebook). "

    "### Performance of Dupuit interface\n",
    "The Dupuit interface, which neglects resistance to vertical flow, is a very accurate approximation of the exact interface for isotropic aquifers. The difference in the position of the toe between the exact and Dupuit solutions increases when the vertical anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity increases. For highly anistropic aquifers, it is proposed to add an effective resistance layer along the bottom of the sea in Dupuit models. The figure shown below gives a flow net for interface flow (no Dupuit approximation) and the scaled along the axes are equal. Note that the variation of the head in the vertical direction is very small except for near the coast line. In the second figure, the interface position for interface flow (no Dupuit approximation, black curve) is compared to the Dupuit interface position (red curve). They are indeed very close.\n",
