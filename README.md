## Laptop Requirement
Each course participant is expected to arrive with a laptop computer that has the required software installed and tested according to the instructions presented here.  Laptop computers should be running a standard installation of either the Windows or Macintosh operating systems. Users should arrive with privileged account access, sometimes called a “PR account”, in the event that additional software installation is required.  Please coordinate with your IT group prior to arriving to the class.

## Software Requirements
We ask that you install and test the following software prior to showing up for the class.  Installers are located on a public ftp site.  A separate email was sent with instructions about software installation.  Please use the provided installers so that everyone is using the same version.

## Internet Availability
The classroom will have wireless Internet.  Those requiring access to the specific domains will need to establish a VPN connection.

## Exercises/Notebooks
Many of the beginning Python concepts will be taught using the Jupyter Notebook, which runs Python from a web browser.  We will also be running Python scripts using the command line and several other approaches.  

## Python Tutorial

For those with little or no Python experience, we request that you complete a couple of online tutorials.  The first tutorial was developed by Mark Bakker, an instructor for this class.  The tutorial is available at:
 
http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/

The second tutorial is available from Code Academy:

http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python

The Code Academy tutorial includes a variety of topics, but we recommend that students take the following:

* Python syntax
* Strings & Console Output
* Date and Time
* Conditionals and Control Flow
* Functions
* Python Lists and Dictionaries
* Lists and Functions*
* Loops
* Advanced Topics in Python
* Introduction to Classes
* Classes
* File Input/Output
